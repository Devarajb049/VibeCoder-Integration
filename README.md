# ðŸ”— VibeCoding Integration

Welcome to the **VibeCoding Integration** repository â€“ a personal space where I combine and showcase work from my primary account [`Devarajb049`](https://github.com/Devarajb049) and my vibe-based creative coding identity [`Mr-VibeCoder`](https://github.com/Mr-VibeCoder).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repo is built to:
- Sync and reflect coding experiments done via `Mr-VibeCoder`
- Store collaborative or fun projects across both identities
- Share tools, utilities, and ideas between my main and vibe accounts
